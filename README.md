Hello! 

This project provides implementations for three data structures:

MyHashTable: A hash table class offering key-value storage with efficient average-case lookups.
MyTestingClass: A custom class used for testing purposes within the MyHashTable.
BST: A binary search tree class that maintains an ordered collection of key-value pairs.
